```
주제에 대한 질문 답변 : 3문제
준비시간 없음!!!!
답변 15초/15초/30초
```

<br>

준비 시간 없이 바로 말해야 돼서 어려운 파트다.

4,5번은 15초로 비교적 간단한 질문, 6번은 30초로 구체적으로 말해야하는 질문

<br>

- **4,5번** : 핵심 + 간단한 부연 설명

- **6번** : 내가 생각하는 것 말하기 + 이에 대한 이유 2가지 설명

<br>

질문이 시작되기 전에 어떤 주제에 대한 내용인지 설명해준다.

```
예시
Imagine that a British Marketing firm is doing research in your country.
~~~~~~~~~~ a telephone interview about traveling
```

**딴거 다 필요없고 맨 마지막 'about' 다음부터 뭔지 보기**

traveling이면 3문제 모두 여행에 대한 질문이 나올 것이므로, 주제에 대해서 읽어줄 때 미리 어떤 질문이 나올지 생각하고 대비하기

(여행을 얼마나 자주가니? 어디로 가는거 좋아하니? 누구랑 가니? 등등)

<br>

사실을 답하는게 아니라 말하기 편한걸 미리 준비한다..!

<br>

**How often**

> twice a month, twice a week, every day 등

**Who ~ with**

> with my best friends

**When was the last time** ~

> The last time ~ was two weeks ago

**How far are you ~**

> It's only five minutes away from my home

**What time ~**

> ~ at 10 am. because It'is very convenient time for me.

<br>

<br>

- 시제 확인 잘하고 답변하기, 답변할 때 **상대방 질문 문장 활용**하기

  **When 'was' the last time that you bought a suitcase?**

  you는 I/me로 바꾸면서 대답, 시제 확인

  답변 : The last time that I bought a suitcase 'was' two months ago

  이처럼 그대로 가져와서 읽으면서 대답하면 시간쓰기 충분

It is very convenient for me.

--------------------------------------------------------
It waste time because (the department store) is one hour away from my home. 
It is very incovenient for me
